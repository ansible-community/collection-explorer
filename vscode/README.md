# ansible-collection-explorer README

Ansible Collection Explorer requires a python 3 environment with galaxy-importer installed. If you have python 3 set up as your default python installation, you can install the importer globally with `pip install galaxy-importer`.

You can also tell Explorer to use a [Python Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) by putting a path to virtual environment in Settings > Extensions > Ansible Collection Explorer.
